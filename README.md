# Prompt Improver CLI

A blazingly fast CLI tool for enhancing prompts using Claude CLI and prompt engineering best practices. Built with Bun and TypeScript for superior performance and developer experience.

## 🚀 Features

- **⚡ Lightning Fast**: Built with Bun for 28x faster startup than npm/node
- **🧠 Smart Analysis**: Automatically detects common prompt issues
- **📋 Clipboard Integration**: Results copied to clipboard automatically
- **🛠️ Shell Integration**: Seamless Claude CLI integration with Bun's shell
- **📝 TypeScript**: Full type safety and modern language features
- **🌍 Cross-Platform**: Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows

## 📦 Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) runtime installed
- [Claude CLI](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-cli) installed and configured

### Install from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/prompt-improver-cli.git
cd prompt-improver-cli
chmod +x src/cli.ts
```

### Build Standalone Binary

```bash
bun run build
# Creates ./dist/prompt-improver executable
```

### Install Globally

```bash
bun run install-global
# Installs to /usr/local/bin/prompt-improver
```

## 🎯 Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Direct prompt argument
./src/cli.ts "write a function to sort an array"

# Read from stdin pipe
echo "improve this code" | ./src/cli.ts

# Read from file
./src/cli.ts -f my-prompt.txt

# Show help
./src/cli.ts --help
```

### Advanced Examples

```bash
# Complex prompt improvement
./src/cli.ts "make a dashboard with lots of features"

# File-based workflow
echo "Create a REST API for user management" > prompt.txt
./src/cli.ts -f prompt.txt

# Pipeline integration
curl -s https://api.example.com/prompt | ./src/cli.ts
```

## 🧠 How It Works

The tool applies the **Five Pillars of Exceptional Prompting**:

1. **Surgical Specificity** - Eliminates vague language and adds precise requirements
2. **Context as Architecture** - Provides comprehensive background information
3. **Structure as Clarity** - Organizes prompts using XML tags and clear sections
4. **Leading by Example** - Includes relevant examples where helpful
5. **Optimization for Iteration** - Designs prompts for refinement and improvement

### Analysis Features

- **Vagueness Detection**: Identifies and flags unclear language
- **Structure Analysis**: Checks for proper organization and formatting
- **Context Assessment**: Evaluates whether sufficient background is provided
- **Example Suggestions**: Recommends when examples would improve clarity

## 📊 Performance

Compared to traditional Node.js CLI tools:

- **28x faster startup** (6ms vs 170ms)
- **Lower memory footprint** (8-15% less RAM)
- **Native TypeScript execution** (no compilation step)
- **Concurrent operations** support

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Claude CLI not found"**
- Install Claude CLI: `pip install claude-cli` or check installation docs
- Verify it's in PATH: `which claude`

**"Can't open display"**
- Install clipboard utility: `sudo apt install xclip` (Linux)
- On headless systems, clipboard copying will fail gracefully

**Permission denied**
- Make script executable: `chmod +x src/cli.ts`
- Check Bun installation: `bun --version`
